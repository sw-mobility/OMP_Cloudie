## SDV-Based Automotive Software Platform with AI Framework Integration

This project focuses on the development of an automotive software platform based on Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV) that integrates AI frameworks for high-speed processing, while meeting the requirements of limited in-vehicle resources and ensuring reliability. Specifically, this project involves the design of a data lake and MLOps for the integration between vehicles and the cloud.

## Key Features

### 1. SDV AI Platform Technology

- **High-speed AI Processing for SDV**: Development of an SDV-specific software platform capable of handling high-speed AI processing, designed to meet the unique constraints and reliability requirements of in-vehicle environments.

### 2. SDV SW Execution and Development Environment Technology

- **CI/CD for SDV Applications**: Support for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) for SDV applications through an integrated software framework. This improves development efficiency by linking cloud and DevOps environments.
- **Container Management**: Technology for managing the deployment and execution of SDV application containers.
- **Data Preprocessing and Cloud Transmission**: Enables preprocessing of vehicle-generated data and ensures optimized transmission to the cloud.
- **Cybersecurity for OTA and Data Transmission**: Implementation of cybersecurity technologies to ensure safe Over-The-Air (OTA) updates and secure data transmission from vehicles.
- **Cloud and Edge Collaboration**: Technologies to support collaboration between vehicle cloud systems and edge computing resources.

### 3. Data Lake and MLOps for Vehicle-Cloud Integration

- **Design of a Data Lake**: A framework to efficiently collect, store, and manage data generated by vehicles and transmitted to the cloud.
- **MLOps for SDV**: The design of MLOps practices to streamline the deployment, monitoring, and updating of machine learning models across the vehicle-cloud ecosystem.
